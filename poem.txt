The Rainbow and the Unicorn and the Ponies

Violet
Indigo
Blue
Green
Yellow
Orange
Unicorn
Red
Red should be before unicorn
These are the colors of the rainbow.
And the unicorn
and ponies.
My poem is not in the same flow.
White is not in the rainbow.
I'm pretty bored so let's go.
I'm pretty good too.
I'm pretty good this specific day.
